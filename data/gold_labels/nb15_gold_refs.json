{
  "Analysis": "This attack type typically shows high Count of same destination address (windowed), Count of same service & destination address (windowed), and Count of same source address (windowed), indicating repeated connections to the same hosts or services. The Connection state and its protocol field often records successful handshakes such as CON or INT, Source inter-packet arrival time (ms) is low due to rapid bursts of traffic, and Destination→source time-to-live remains consistent, reflecting probes to fixed targets. Repeated, rapid probes to the same destinations with consistent TTL values and short inter-packet timing suggest reconnaissance-style analysis of services and systems.",
  "Backdoor": "Backdoor activity often exhibits unusual port usage with low Count of same service & source address (windowed) and Count of same source address & destination port (windowed) values, indicating access to specific entry points. There may be small Bytes from destination to source and Size of data returned by server’s HTTP service values due to minimal interaction after access, occasional high 1 if FTP session used user+password; else 0 values if FTP is used, and abnormal connection states like REJ or RST. Irregular port usage with minimal traffic volume and limited flows suggests covert, unauthorized access attempts through backdoor mechanisms.",
  "DoS": "Denial-of-Service attacks generally present very high Connection rate (packets per second), Packet count source→destination, and Bytes from source to destination values, combined with low Source inter-packet arrival time (ms) and Destination inter-packet arrival time (ms) due to extremely rapid packet arrivals. Connection states often show incomplete sessions such as REQ, INT, or RST, and both Source packets retransmitted/dropped and Destination packets retransmitted/dropped are elevated from packet drops. Extremely high packet rate and losses, along with incomplete or reset connections, signal volumetric flooding typical of DoS attacks.",
  "Exploits": "Exploit traffic frequently shows higher Depth into HTTP request/response transaction values due to deeper protocol interactions, variable Size of data returned by server’s HTTP service from abnormal server behavior, and changes in Source→destination time-to-live or Destination→source time-to-live compared to normal flows. Depending on the attack vector, Number of flows with an FTP command or Number of flows with HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST) can be elevated. Abnormal transaction depths and unusual response patterns suggest attempts to exploit application-level vulnerabilities.",
  "Fuzzers": "Fuzzing attacks often produce irregular Mean packet size sent by source and Mean packet size sent by destination values, reflecting erratic packet sizes, along with high Connection rate (packets per second) and substantial Source packets retransmitted/dropped and Destination packets retransmitted/dropped due to malformed packets. Connection states are frequently abnormal or abruptly terminated. Irregular traffic characteristics with malformed or dropped packets point to fuzzing activity targeting application robustness.",
  "Generic": "Generic attacks usually involve very high Connection rate (packets per second), Source bits per second, and Destination bits per second values, along with elevated Count of same destination address (windowed) and Count of same service & destination address (windowed) from repeated targeting of many endpoints or services. The 1 if src IP = dst IP and src port = dst port; else 0 flag may be set to 1 when IP-port pairs are reused. High-volume, repetitive interactions across services and ports indicate general-purpose automated attacks like brute-force or flooding.",
  "Normal": "Normal network activity maintains balanced Bytes from source to destination and Bytes from destination to source values with low packet rates, and uses common connection states such as FIN, EST, or ACC. Count of same source address (windowed) and Count of same service & destination address (windowed) tend to be low to moderate, reflecting typical, non-repetitive interactions. Normal flows maintain expected packet sizes and timing, successful state transitions, and minimal repeated interactions.",
  "Reconnaissance": "Reconnaissance activity tends to show high Count of same destination address (windowed) and Count of same source & destination addresses (windowed) values from scanning many targets, with moderate to high Connection rate (packets per second) and Packet count source→destination values. Bytes from destination to source is often zero due to silent probing, and Source inter-packet arrival time (ms) is very low as packets are sent in rapid succession. Many short, one-way flows with no response and rapid-fire packets are indicative of stealthy reconnaissance scans.",
  "Shellcode": "Shellcode-related traffic often contains very low Bytes from source to destination and Bytes from destination to source values since the payloads are small, deeper Depth into HTTP request/response transaction from exploitation of application protocols, and abnormal connection states. The Count of same service & destination address (windowed) value is typically low, as attacks target specific hosts. Short, targeted traffic patterns with minimal data exchange and abnormal session states suggest shellcode injection attempts.",
  "Worms": "Worm propagation is characterized by high Count of same destination address (windowed), Count of same service & destination address (windowed), and Count of same source address & destination port (windowed) values, reflecting numerous connections to different hosts and ports. Packet count source→destination, Packet count destination→source, and Connection rate (packets per second) are moderate but sustained, and Source inter-packet arrival time (ms) remains consistently low, showing automated spreading. Repetitive flows to numerous destinations at consistent intervals are signs of worm propagation behavior."
