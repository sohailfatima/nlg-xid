{
  "Normal": "Connections in this category typically use a standard protocol type and a consistent application/service on the destination, with balanced source bytes and destination bytes transfer. Successful login is common, and the percentage to the same service is high while SYN error rate and REJ error rate remain low. The connection used standard protocols (e.g., HTTP or FTP), with balanced data transfer between source and destination (src_bytes, dst_bytes). No suspicious content was flagged (hot=0, num_failed_logins=0, num_compromised=0), and the user successfully logged in (logged_in=1). Most destination hosts and services were consistent (same_srv_rate high), with low error rates (serror_rate=0, rerror_rate=0).",
  
  "DoS": "Such traffic often shows very high counts of connections to the same host and the same service, as well as a high number of connections to the same destination host. The SYN error rate, SYN error rate for the same service, and SYN error rate within the host window are frequently at maximum levels. Source bytes are often minimal, and connection status flags may indicate rejection or incomplete handshakes. The connection involved extremely high numbers of requests to the same host or service in a short period (count, srv_count, dst_host_count near 255). The connection often failed with SYN or REJ errors (serror_rate=1.0, rerror_rate=1.0, dst_host_serror_rate=1.0). The service may be set to private or use malformed requests, and src_bytes is often low or zero, as the attacker sends many requests but expects no response.",
  
  "R2L": "This attack type usually has multiple failed login attempts, sometimes followed by a successful login. It often targets services such as FTP, Telnet, or SMTP. Guest logins may be used, and source bytes tend to be low while destination bytes are relatively high. Additional indicators may include suspicious content signals, operations on access-control files, and occasional shell invocations. The attacker attempts to guess passwords or exploit login vulnerabilities, leading to many failed login attempts (num_failed_logins > 0), often followed by a successful login (logged_in=1). The service is usually ftp, telnet, or smtp, and features like is_guest_login=1 or is_host_login=1 may be activated. These attacks involve low src_bytes but high dst_bytes (small payloads requesting sensitive data).",
  
  "U2R": "These connections often show shell prompts being invoked, root shell access obtained, or attempts to switch to root privileges. They may involve file creation operations, operations on access-control files, root-level accesses, and suspicious content indicators. The attacker has local access (often already logged in) and performs suspicious system operations, such as shell access (num_shells > 0), file creation (num_file_creations > 0), and access to restricted files (num_access_files > 0). Indicators of successful privilege escalation include root_shell=1 or su_attempted=1.",
  
  "Probe": "Probe activity typically involves high percentages of connections to different services or to different hosts among the same service. It may also have large counts of connections to the same host and service, but source bytes and destination bytes are often minimal. Connection status flags frequently indicate rejection or incomplete sessions. The connection targets multiple hosts or services in a short time, with a high percentage of requests to different services (diff_srv_rate high) or different hosts (srv_diff_host_rate high). There is often little or no data transfer (src_bytes=0, dst_bytes=0) and services are probed without completing handshakes (flag=REJ, S0)."
