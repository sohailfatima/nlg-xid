    "**Incident Analysis: Denial of Service (DoS) Classification** The machine learning model has classified this network event as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The key contributing features and their SHAP values indicate that the model has identified a pattern consistent with a DoS attack. Here's a breakdown of the most important features and their implications: 1. **Transport protocol (tcp)**: The use of TCP as the transport protocol is not inherently suspicious, but it's a common protocol used in DoS attacks, particularly in amplification attacks. 2. **Length of the connection (seconds) = 0**: This feature suggests that the connection was extremely short-lived, which is a characteristic of DoS attacks. Attackers often use short-lived connections to evade detection and make it difficult to analyze the attack. 3. **Bytes sent from source to destination = 0**: This feature indicates that no data was sent from the source to the destination, which is a hallmark of a DoS attack. In a...",

    "**Event Classification: Normal** The machine learning model classified this network event as \"Normal\" based on the following key contributing features: 1. **Application/service on destination (ftp_data)**: The event involves a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) data transfer, which is a common and legitimate network activity. FTP is a standard protocol used for transferring files between systems, and the presence of ftp_data as the application/service on the destination indicates a normal, expected behavior. 2. **Connection status at summary time (SF)**: The connection status is marked as \"SF\", which typically indicates a successful connection. This suggests that the FTP transfer was completed without any issues, further supporting the classification as normal. 3. **Bytes sent from source to destination (276)**: The relatively small amount of data transferred (276 bytes) is consistent with a typical FTP data transfer, which often involves small to moderate-sized files. 4. **Bytes sent...",
    "**Classification Decision: \"Normal\"** The machine learning model classified this network event as \"Normal\" due to the presence of several key contributing features that indicate a benign and expected network activity. The most important features and their implications are: 1. **Application/service on destination (http)**: The destination service is HTTP, which is a common and legitimate protocol for web traffic. This suggests that the connection is likely a user-initiated request for a web page or resource. 2. **Connection status at summary time (SF)**: The connection status is \"SF\", which indicates that the connection was successfully established and terminated normally. This suggests that the connection was not interrupted or terminated abnormally, which is often a sign of malicious activity. 3. **Bytes sent from source to destination (297) and Bytes sent from destination to source (2184)**: The large difference in bytes sent between the source and destination (2184 vs 297)...",

    "**Classification Decision: \"Normal\"** The machine learning model classified this network event as \"Normal\" based on the following key contributing features: 1. **Application/service on destination (http)**: The destination service is HTTP, a common and legitimate protocol used for web browsing and communication. This suggests that the connection is likely a normal, expected communication between a client and a web server. 2. **Length of the connection (seconds) = 0**: The connection duration is extremely short (0 seconds), indicating that the connection was likely a brief, one-off event, such as a DNS query or a TCP SYN packet. This is a strong indicator of a normal, benign connection. 3. **Transport protocol (tcp)**: The use of TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a standard protocol for reliable, connection-oriented communication. This is a normal and expected protocol for many network applications. 4. **Connection status at summary time (SF)**: The connection status is \"SF\",...",
    "Based on the provided SHAP values, the machine learning model classified this network event as \"Probe\" primarily due to the following key contributing features: 1. **Application/service on destination (e.g., http, telnet, ftp, \u2026) = private**: This feature indicates that the destination service is not a well-known, publicly accessible service (e.g., HTTP, FTP, or Telnet). This could suggest that the destination is a private or internal service, which may be a target for reconnaissance or probing activities. 2. **Percentage with the same source port (within the host window) = +0.000**: Although the SHAP value is zero, this feature is still relevant. The fact that the source port is the same across multiple connections within a short time window (host window) may indicate a probing activity, where an attacker is scanning or testing a system's defenses. 3. **Percentage to the same service (within the host window) = +0.000**: Similar to the previous feature, the fact that the destination...",
    "**Classification Decision: DoS (Denial of Service)** The machine learning model has classified this network event as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The key contributing features that support this decision are: 1. **Connection status at summary time (REJ)**: The connection was rejected, indicating that the destination host was unable to establish a valid connection. This is a strong indicator of a DoS attack, where the attacker is overwhelming the target host with traffic, causing it to reject legitimate connections. 2. **Transport protocol (TCP)**: The use of TCP as the transport protocol suggests a more targeted and sustained attack, as TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that requires a three-way handshake to establish a connection. 3. **Bytes sent from source to destination (0)**: The fact that no bytes were sent from the source to the destination suggests that the attacker is not attempting to transmit legitimate data, but rather is flooding the target host with traffic to...",
