This is a normal state for a TCP connection, as it signifies the completion of a transaction or the termination of a session. The other features, such as Transaction protocol (tcp), Application/service (-), Bytes from source to destination, Mean packet size sent by source, and others, have minimal impact on the classification decision, with SHAP values close to zero....",
    "**Event Classification: Normal** The machine learning model classified this network event as \"Normal\" due to the following key contributing features: 1. **id (+1.599)**: The event ID (27508) is a unique identifier, which is not inherently suspicious. However, the high SHAP value indicates that this feature played a significant role in the classification decision. This suggests that the model is relying on the event's uniqueness to determine its normalcy. 2. **Transaction protocol (udp)**: The use of UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a common protocol for DNS (Domain Name System) traffic, which is expected in this case (Application/service = dns). This feature is not inherently suspicious, as UDP is often used for DNS queries and responses. 3. **Application/service (dns)**: The event involves DNS traffic, which is a normal and expected protocol for resolving domain names. This feature supports the classification decision, as DNS traffic is typically benign. The other features, such as...",
    "**Event Analysis: Exploits Classification** The machine learning model classified this network event as \"Exploits\" based on the following key contributing features: 1. **id=97758**: This feature is not directly related to the exploit classification, but it's a unique identifier for the event, which helps in tracking and analyzing the incident. 2. **Transaction protocol=ospf**: OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) is a routing protocol used for intra-domain routing in IP networks. The presence of OSPF traffic is unusual in this context, as it's typically used for routing and not for user-facing applications. This discrepancy raises suspicion. 3. **Application/service=-**: The absence of a specific application or service (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SSH, DNS) indicates that the traffic is not related to a typical user interaction. This lack of context suggests that the traffic might be malicious or unauthorized. 4. **Bytes from source to destination=16320**: The significant amount of data sent from...",
