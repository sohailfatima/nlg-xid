Key factors: Bytes sent from source to destination increased the model's confidence; Application/service on destination (e.g., http, telnet, ftp, \u2026) increased the model's confidence; Percentage to different services (within the host window) increased the model's confidence; Percentage with the same source port (within the host window) increased the model's confidence; Connections to the same host increased the model's confidence.",
    "The model classified this connection as 'Normal' Normal traffic patterns detected. Key factors: Application/service on destination (e.g., http, telnet, ftp, \u2026) increased the model's confidence; Failed login attempts increased the model's confidence; Bytes sent from source to destination increased the model's confidence; Percentage with the same source port (within the host window) increased the model's confidence; Bytes sent from destination to source increased the model's confidence.",
    "The model classified this connection as 'DoS' Unusually high Connections to the same host/Connections to the same service suggests repeated rapid connections. Connection flag REJ indicates incomplete or rejected handshakes, common in SYN floods. Key factors: Bytes sent from source to destination increased the model's confidence; Connections to the same host increased the model's confidence; Percentage with the same source port (within the host window) increased the model's confidence; Percentage with REJ errors (within the host window) increased the model's confidence; Percentage to the same service increased the model's confidence.",
