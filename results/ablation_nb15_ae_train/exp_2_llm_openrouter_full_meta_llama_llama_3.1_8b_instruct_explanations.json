    "Based on the provided SHAP values, the machine learning model has identified the following key contributing features that led to the classification of the network event as \"Normal\": 1. **Transaction protocol (udp)**: The use of UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a common protocol for many network applications, including DNS, DHCP, and VoIP. The model's low SHAP value for this feature suggests that the use of UDP alone is not a significant indicator of malicious activity. 2. **Application/service (-)**: The absence of a specific application/service (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SSH) in the SHAP values indicates that the model did not find any unusual or suspicious activity related to a specific application. This is a good sign, as it suggests that the network traffic is not indicative of a targeted attack. 3. **Source\u2192destination time-to-live (31)**: The time-to-live (TTL) value of 31 is a reasonable value for a UDP packet, indicating that the packet is not being excessively forwarded or delayed....",
    "Based on the provided network event details, the machine learning model classified it as \"Generic\" due to the following key contributing features and their implications: 1. **Transaction protocol: UDP (0.000 SHAP value)**: The use of UDP as the transaction protocol is a contributing factor to the \"Generic\" classification. UDP is a connectionless protocol, which means it doesn't establish a dedicated connection between the sender and receiver. This can make it more challenging to detect and analyze malicious activity, as it doesn't leave a clear trail of communication. In a security context, UDP can be used for legitimate purposes, such as DNS queries, but it can also be exploited by attackers for reconnaissance or data exfiltration. 2. **Application/service: DNS (0.000 SHAP value)**: The fact that the application/service is DNS is another contributing factor.
