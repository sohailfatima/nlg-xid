      "rationale": "The explanation emphasizes the 'id' feature as a key driver, which aligns with its high SHAP value, but the rationale that 'id' indicates normalcy is weak, as IDs are often arbitrary identifiers not directly indicative of normal behavior. The mention of 'transaction protocol' as common and expected is accurate, but the explanation does not clearly connect how these features collectively justify the 'Normal' prediction or address potential caveats. Overall, the explanation is somewhat superficial, lacking detailed reasoning about how the features support the classification and missing coverage of other relevant features or possible anomalies.",
